# README: Camila Nkhama

## Who I Am
I am Camila Nkhama, originally born in Zimbabwe, but grew up in South Africa as my parents relocated here 18 years ago in hopes for a better future. I am currently living in the hopes of the better future they intended to build. To have completed my BCom in Information systems udergraduate degree at one of the Top instituitions in the country and now currently completing my Honours in Informatics at Stellenbosch University is one of the greatest acheivements of my life.

## Personality Profile
- **Dominant trait**: People-focused leadership with strategic vision
- **How this shows up in my work**: I naturally gravitate toward projects that have clear human impact, and I'm energised by collaborative environments where I can help others succeed while driving toward ambitious goals
- **In technical settings**: I excel at translating between stakeholders and development teams, ensuring technical solutions actually solve real user problems

## My Approach to Problem-Solving

### 1. Systems Thinking First
When I encounter a new challenge, my first instinct is to map out the ecosystem. At the Dresden AI Hackathon, while others dove straight into coding, I spent the first hour understanding the customer support workflow, pain points, and success metrics. This systems-level perspective helped our team build a more targeted solution.

### 2. Prototype Early, Iterate Fast
I believe in making ideas tangible quickly. Whether it's a Figma mockup, a Python script, or even a hand-drawn workflow diagram, I prefer to externalise thinking early and refine through feedback rather than perfect in isolation.

### 3. Human-Centered Technical Decisions
Every technical choice I make starts with "Who is this serving and how?" This philosophy drove my approach as a Teaching Assistant - I don't just explain concepts; I adapt my teaching style to different learning preferences and create environments where students feel safe to make mistakes.


### Work Environment Preferences:
- **High autonomy with clear outcomes**: Give me a problem to solve and trust me to find the path, even if it takes hours on end to solve, I believe in persevering :)))
- **Regular feedback loops**: I actively seek input and use it to iterate quickly
- **Diverse, intellectually curious team**: I thrive around people who challenge my thinking and bring different perspectives

### What Drains Me:
- Purely maintenance work without growth opportunities
- Siloed roles where I can't see broader impact
- Environments where failure is punished rather than treated as learning

## Technical Philosophy

### Code Quality
I inted to write code like I'm explaining it to my future self in 6 months. Clear variable names, comprehensive comments, and modular structure aren't optional - they're respect for whoever has to work with the code later (usually me).
.

### Continuous Learning
Technology evolves faster than formal education can keep up with. I stay current through project-based learning, online courses.


### In Leadership Roles:
(From my experience as RCL Chairperson and Teaching Assistant)
I lead by creating clarity and removing obstacles for others. My style is collaborative but decisive - I gather input widely, then make clear calls on direction and timing.

## Values in Professional Settings

### Innovation with Purpose
I'm not interested in technology for its own sake. The most satisfying projects are those where clever technical solutions create measurable improvements in people's lives or work.

### Growth Mindset
I actively seek out challenges that push beyond my comfort zone. The Dresden hackathon was intimidating - I was one of only 5 students selected internationally - but that stretch led to some of my most rapid learning.

### Inclusive Excellence
High standards don't mean leaving people behind. Whether as a Teaching Assistant or team member, I believe in creating environments where everyone can do their best work.

## Current Focus Areas

**Expanding AI/ML Capabilities**: Moving beyond prompt engineering to understand model training, evaluation, and deployment pipelines

**Full-Stack Proficiency**: Strengthening backend development skills to complement my growing frontend and AI experience

**Product Thinking**: Learning to balance user needs, technical constraints, and business objectives in solution design

## Looking Forward
I'm drawn to roles where I can combine technical execution with strategic thinking, particularly in organisations building AI-driven products that solve real human problems. I want to be part of teams that move fast, learn from mistakes, and create solutions that matter.
