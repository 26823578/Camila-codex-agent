e3682b2 | Camila Nkhama | 2025-08-23 22:08:28 +0000 | added sidebar file upload and ingest workflow with improved Q&A layout - Separates data management from Q&A controls for better usability - Allows dynamic document uploads and index rebuilding without redeploy
8de25a6 | Camila Nkhama | 2025-08-23 22:00:24 +0000 | added self-relection feature
ecd9c30 | Camila Nkhama | 2025-08-23 20:55:44 +0000 | - Separate controls and Q&A into columns for clarity - Mode and k are configurable to test different retrieval/answering styles - Added ingest trigger for quick dataset updates without redeploy - Display retrieved chunks for transparency and traceability
3663cdb | Camila Nkhama | 2025-08-23 20:47:35 +0000 | added separate mode definitions so it’s simple to add/remove modes. construct_prompt concatenates retrieved chunks (with source metadata) so reviewer can validate the grounding.
daafd45 | Camila Nkhama | 2025-08-23 20:26:56 +0000 | Keeping retrieval logic separate makes the codebase more modular and easier to maintain. If retrieval is isolated (e.g., in rag.py), I can adjust chunking, embeddings, or retriever parameters without touching the core agent logic. This separation also makes testing simpler (unit test retrieval independently), allows swapping retrievers (e.g., FAISS → Chroma → pgvector), and keeps the agent’s job focused on prompt orchestration and response generation. In short, retrieval returns the top-k chunks to feed into the prompt, while the agent logic stays clean and adaptable.
5a0ff01 | Camila Nkhama | 2025-08-23 20:19:32 +0000 | Ingest.py is designed for simplicity and robustness. It segments text by sentences rather than fixed character lengths, improving coherence. Context is preserved across chunks using overlap. It leverages OpenAI embeddings for high-quality semantic representation and FAISS for fast, local similarity search.
