I am currently living in the hopes of the better future they intended to build. To have completed my BCom in Information systems udergraduate degree at one of the Top instituitions in the country and now currently completing my Honours in Informatics at Stellenbosch University is one of the greatest acheivements of my life. ## Personality Profile\n- **Dominant trait**: People-focused leadership with strategic vision\n- **How this shows up in my work**: I naturally gravitate toward projects that have clear human impact, and I'm energised by collaborative environments where I can help others succeed while driving toward ambitious goals\n- **In technical settings**: I excel at translating between stakeholders and development teams, ensuring technical solutions actually solve real user problems\n\n## My Approach to Problem-Solving\n\n### 1. Systems Thinking First\nWhen I encounter a new challenge, my first instinct is to map out the ecosystem. At the Dresden AI Hackathon, while others dove straight into coding, I spent the first hour understanding the customer support workflow, pain points, and success metrics. This systems-level perspective helped our team build a more targeted solution. ### 2. Prototype Early, Iterate Fast\nI believe in making ideas tangible quickly. Whether it's a Figma mockup, a Python script, or even a hand-drawn workflow diagram, I prefer to externalise thinking early and refine through feedback rather than perfect in isolation. ### 3. Human-Centered Technical Decisions\nEvery technical choice I make starts with \"Who is this serving and how?\" This philosophy drove my approach as a Teaching Assistant - I don't just explain concepts; I adapt my teaching style to different learning preferences and create environments where students feel safe to make mistakes. ### Work Environment Preferences:\n- **High autonomy with clear outcomes**: Give me a problem to solve and trust me to find the path, even if it takes hours on end to solve, I believe in persevering :)))\n- **Regular feedback loops**: I actively seek input and use it to iterate quickly\n- **Diverse, intellectually curious team**: I thrive around people who challenge my thinking and bring different perspectives\n\n### What Drains Me:\n- Purely maintenance work without growth opportunities\n- Siloed roles where I can't see broader impact\n- Environments where failure is punished rather than treated as learning\n\n## Technical Philosophy\n\n### Code Quality\nI inted to write code like I'm explaining it to my future self in 6 months."}

I am currently \ncompleting my Honours in Informati cs at Stellenbosch University, with a Bachelor of Commerce \nin Information Systems as my undergraduate foundation. I brin g with me a strong academic \nrecord, hands -on technical skills, and a passion for applying technology to solve real -world \nchallenges. Recently, I had the privilege of representing Stellenbosch University at an international AI \nHackathon hosted at TU Dresden  in collaboration with the Otto Group. In this high -pressure \nenvironment, I focused on backend prompt engineering using Python and Google\u2019s Gemini \nmodels on Vertex AI, contributing to the development of an AI -powered customer support tool. This experience sharpened my problem -solving abilities, strengthened my collaboration skills, \nand deepened my interest in AI -driven solutions. Throughout my studies, I\u2019ve worked with tools like  Python, JavaScript,  React JS, SQL, \nPocketbase, Figma, and RStudio  etc, and served as a teaching assistant , which has helped me \nbalance technical precision with clear communication. I would welcome the oppor tunity to grow within a team that values innovation, learning, and \nimpact. Thank you for considering my application . I would be happy to provide any further \ninformation or supporting documents. Kind regards , \nCamila Nkham a \ncamila.nkhama@gmail.com | 066 061 0353"}
